# React Native Test

Used mainly for experimental purposes -- currently only with Android.
```
	react-native run-android
	json-server db.json --watch
```

Remember to run ```react-native run-android``` after running the emulator (or connecting your device). Check to see if your device is connected by running ```adb devices```.
